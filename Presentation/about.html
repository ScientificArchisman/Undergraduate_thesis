				<h1>About the Project</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Our project is focused on designing a system to make predictions about cardiovascular diseases using deep learning and machine learning. We used the MIT-BIT dataset, which contains data on five different types of cardiovascular conditions. Our system can accurately predict whether a patient is at risk of developing a cardiovascular disease based on their medical history and other relevant factors.</p>
                <p>We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with 1D convolutional layers for our deep learning model. To ensure the accuracy of our predictions, we applied Convolutional filtering and Gustafsson's method to filter and clean the data before training our model. In addition to deep learning, we also used a histogram gradient boosting classifier for machine learning to further improve our accuracy.</p>
                <p>This project represents a significant breakthrough in the field of cardiovascular disease research. It could help doctors and healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and provide better care to patients. Our team worked hard to design and optimize the system, and we're proud of the results we've achieved.</p>		
                <p>We achieved a validation accuracy of 96% for the machine learning model and almost 99% for the CNN, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>	</section>
